##🔹 1. API Data Retrieval and Storage

In this module, data is fetched from an external REST API that provides a list of books in JSON format. Each book contains attributes such as title, author, and publication year.
The retrieved data is parsed using Python, and a SQLite database is created locally to store the book information. The data is then inserted into the database using SQL queries, ensuring persistent storage. Finally, the stored records are retrieved from the database and displayed to verify successful insertion.

##🔹 2. Data Processing and Visualization

This component focuses on data analysis and visualization. Student test score data is fetched from an API and processed in Python to calculate the average score. The processed data is then visualized using a bar chart, which provides a clear comparison of individual student scores. This visualization helps in understanding performance trends and makes the data easier to interpret.

🔹 3. CSV Data Import to a Database

In this module, user information such as name and email is read from a CSV file using Python’s CSV handling capabilities. The script creates a SQLite database table (if it does not already exist) and inserts the CSV data into the database. This demonstrates how structured data from files can be efficiently imported into a relational database for further
